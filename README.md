##### 未完成project

1.Try to Implement this scheme(below)

2.PoC impl of the scheme, or do implement analysis by Google

3.send a tx on Bitcoin testnet, and parse the tx data down to every bit, better write script yourself

4.research report on MPT

5.Find a 64-byte message under some k fulfilling that their hash value is symmetrical
